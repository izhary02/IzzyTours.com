## A vacation website that offers a variety of vacations and tracks which vacations the users like best


This project allows users to see what vacations exist,
to mark which vacations interest them and that way they will be the first they see,
to be updated in real time when a new vacation is added

and allows the administrator to upload new vacations,
delete irrelevant vacations,
see statistics of some vacations preferred by the users that change in real time

In the project directory, you can run Backend & Frontend separately:
